### What is `uter`?

`uter` is a javascript library which takes a functional approach to journeying with data through an application. Using the basic constructs of a `Left` wrapper or a `Right` wrapper, data can functionally pass through many layers of your application without having to bubble through exceptions or rejected promises.
